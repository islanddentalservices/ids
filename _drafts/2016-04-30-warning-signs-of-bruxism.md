Do you recognize any of these signs? If so, you could be suffering from Bruxism.

+ **A dull headache when you wake in the morning**. Bruxism makes you three times more likely to suffer from headaches. 

+ **The sound of tooth-grinding at night**, perhaps disturbing the sleep of your partner or someone else sleeping nearby. 

+ **Tooth wear, sensitivity or damage to your dental fittings**. Grinding and clenching can damage your teeth, causing pain by exposing the sensitive pulp inside.

+ **Jaw pains** or difficulty in opening your mouth. 
 
+ **Persistent pain in your face**.
   
Bruxism (pronounced brooks-ism) is the dental term for tooth-grinding or clenching. Most of us occasionally do it but for around 10% of people, it develops into a habit that may lead to damaged teeth or jaws. 

Bruxism is often a reaction to stress but it can also have purely physical causes.
