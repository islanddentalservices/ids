+ Angie, our reception manager,  will be happy to discuss payment plans with you to determine the options best suited to your needs. 

+ For example, if you are an OAP and need an £850 set of dentures you might pay half upfront with the payable rest on completion, or pay a proportion of the total each visit or even spread the payment out over many months. 

+ At a minimum we will normally need to cover our running costs of approximately £100 per hour. 

+ When a treatment requires that we pay laboratory fees, we need to charge for those fees upfront.

+ Angie will provide you with a written agreement together with your treatment plan.
