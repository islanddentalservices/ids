+ Our hygienist will provide all normal services from Oral Hygiene Instruction to deep cleaning under local anaesthetic.

+ The dentist will normally provide a simple scale and polish in the check up appointment to save you from coming back twice.

+ The frequency of scaling visits will be jointly determined by you and the dentist.
Some people never require it and some every 3 months.
