<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/keith-tierney.jpg">  

I graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons in 1983 having trained at Guys Hospital from 1978.

After Briefly working in two NHS/ Private mixed Practices in London, I moved to the Island in 1986 and have been the Principal of Island Dental Services, East Cowes, ever since. 

Initially I treated 35-45 patients on the NHS per day. I learnt to run a very efficient practice and gained many skills in all aspects of general Dentistry. Due to the continuing problems within the NHS I converted together with the rest of the clinic to fully private Dentistry some years ago. 

I now treat around 8 patients a day, ensuring the highest quality work. 
My areas of special interest include Root Canal treatments, Dentures, Advanced Full Mouth Rehabilitation and Gum surgery (including bone regeneration).
I completed a 1 year course in General Medical and Dental Homeopathy at the Royal College London in 2009 .

When not working I like to Swim and Kayak. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and used to climb and trek remote locations particularly South America. I still travel and love to scuba dive.


### Kathryn Birnie

My first experience of a Dental Hygienist was at primary school.  A glamorous lady came to explain the importance of cleaning our teeth.  The talk finished with her saying ‘you’ll need good teeth if you want to be pop stars when you grow up’.  From that moment onwards I wanted to be a Dental Hygienist.  

I went from Sandown High School to the Isle Of Wight College of Arts and Technology (as it was known back then) pre-nursing course as my parents wanted me to have an opportunity to explore different career choices.  My resolve was absolute and I was accepted at Turner’s Dental Hospital, Manchester and qualified as a Dental Hygienist in 1980.  

I have spent the majority of my career working on the Island.  I did work in London for a short period but I missed all things Isle of Wight too much to stay there.  I am committed to keeping up to date with scientific developments in dental health in order to provide the best possible service to my patients.  I do this through regular continued professional development and by membership of the British Society of Dental Hygiene and Therapy and the Faculty of General Dental Practice.  I have a particular interest in working with anxious patients to find solutions to their issues about dental treatment.  

My other lifelong passion is horses.  In 1990 I took a year’s sabbatical to gain a M.Sc. in Equine Science from Aberystwyth and Edinburgh Universities.  I have used this knowledge to write for the popular equestrian press and to provide occasional lectures.
I joined the wonderful team at Island Dental Services in 2013.  I am looking forwards to continuing care for our existing patients and welcoming new patients to our practice.

### Karen Cassford  

**Therapist**

I have been in the dental industry since the age of 17, where I started my dental life as an orthodontic nurse in my home town of Horsham West Sussex, and I stayed in that position for 4 years until I decided it was time to expand my knowledge and move areas. 

I moved to the Isle of Wight at the end of 1995 and started working as a trainee dental nurse. In 1997 I gained my NEBDN dental nursing qualification and shortly after this took position as a dental nurse with Keith Tierney at his Ryde Surgery, working with the associate dentists.

Between 1999 and 2004 I gained higher education certificates in dental nursing, oral health education and radiography. During this time I worked at the Ryde and East Cowes surgeries and also worked at Bembridge.
In 2004 I was privileged to be one of the first cohorts of students to train as a dual qualified hygienist/therapist at the School of Professionals Complementary to Dentistry in Portsmouth, from which, I graduated in June 2007 with a First Class Honours degree. 

In July 2007, I returned to work in my new position of Dental Therapist/Hygienist both at East Cowes and Bembridge and also worked some hours at another surgery in Ryde.  
In 2012 I went to work within the NHS and community expanding my skills and knowledge treating lots of children and dental phobics.

Outside of Work I have a very busy life with two young children Sophia-Chantelle who is 5 and Ethan who is 4. We have two rescue Lucher dogs, and we love the outdoors, walking and hiking our way around the Island or Devon.  My husband works as a machine operative and HGV driver. He also is an adult instructor in the Army Cadet Force.

In the past I have travelled extensively through India and Australia and various other destinations and have had some amazing adventures.
