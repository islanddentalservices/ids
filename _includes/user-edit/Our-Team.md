**Practice Principal**  

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/keith-tierney.jpg">  

I graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons in 1983 having trained at Guys Hospital from 1978.

After Briefly working in two NHS/ Private mixed Practices in London, I moved to the Island in 1986 and have been the Principal of Island Dental Services, East Cowes, ever since. 

Initially I treated 35-45 patients on the NHS per day. I learnt to run a very efficient practice and gained many skills in all aspects of general Dentistry. Due to the continuing problems within the NHS I converted together with the rest of the clinic to fully private Dentistry some years ago. 

I now treat around 8 patients a day, ensuring the highest quality work. 
My areas of special interest include Root Canal treatments, Dentures, Advanced Full Mouth Rehabilitation and Gum surgery (including bone regeneration).
I completed a 1 year course in General Medical and Dental Homeopathy at the Royal College London in 2009 .

When not working I like to Swim and Kayak. I have travelled extensively throughout the world and used to climb and trek remote locations particularly South America. I still travel and love to scuba dive.


### Kathryn Birnie  

**Hygienist**  G.D.C 2093

My first experience of a Dental Hygienist was at primary school.  A glamorous lady came to explain the importance of cleaning our teeth.  The talk finished with her saying ‘you’ll need good teeth if you want to be pop stars when you grow up’.  From that moment onwards I wanted to be a Dental Hygienist.  

I went from Sandown High School to the Isle Of Wight College of Arts and Technology (as it was known back then) pre-nursing course as my parents wanted me to have an opportunity to explore different career choices.  My resolve was absolute and I was accepted at Turner’s Dental Hospital, Manchester and qualified as a Dental Hygienist in 1980.  

I have spent the majority of my career working on the Island.  I did work in London for a short period but I missed all things Isle of Wight too much to stay there.  I am committed to keeping up to date with scientific developments in dental health in order to provide the best possible service to my patients.  I do this through regular continued professional development and by membership of the British Society of Dental Hygiene and Therapy and the Faculty of General Dental Practice.  I have a particular interest in working with anxious patients to find solutions to their issues about dental treatment.  

My other lifelong passion is horses.  In 1990 I took a year’s sabbatical to gain a M.Sc. in Equine Science from Aberystwyth and Edinburgh Universities.  I have used this knowledge to write for the popular equestrian press and to provide occasional lectures.
I joined the wonderful team at Island Dental Services in 2013.  I am looking forwards to continuing care for our existing patients and welcoming new patients to our practice.
